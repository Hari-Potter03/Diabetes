# Diabetes

## Description
In this project on diabetes, I conducted a comprehensive analysis using R Markdown. It all began with importing the diabetes dataset for analysis. In the exploratory analysis, I checked out the dataset's structure and created visual plots to understand how age relates to diabetes outcomes. To ensure the reliability of the model, I also examined multicollinearity between variables. Moving on to the modeling part, I crafted a logistic regression model to predict diabetes outcomes. To fine-tune the model, I used a backward-stepwise approach to pick the most important predictors. I evaluated the model's performance with accuracy measures, ROC curve analysis, and sensitivity-specificity calculations. And to make sure it's robust, I implemented k-fold cross-validation. 

## Results

### Model Accuracy
Accuracy = 0.83
